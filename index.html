        <h4>Instructions for seasonal-sales exercise</h3>
        
        <p>  Your job is to build a department store's web page that lists products, the name of the department each one is in, and the price.The two JSON representations above should be in two files: 'products.json', and 'categories.json'. Use Javascript's 'XMLHttpRequest()' method to read the data from those files, and then build HTML representations of the data.</p>
        
        <h4>Discounts</h3>
        
        <p>Now that you've populate the view with all of the products, put a '&lt;select&gt;' element at the top of the page that contains all possible values of the 'season_discount' key in the categories file. As soon as you select one of the seasons, all prices on the page should immediately be discounted by the corresponding percentage.</p>

        <p> For example, when _Spring_ is chosen, all products in the corresponding Household category should have their prices updated with a 15% discount off the base price.</p>
